# Pathfinder

A bot that searches through all links on a page and follows their links, and so forth, and outputs results to a file.

# Setup

1. Go to [this link](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) and download the correct Chrome driver for your version of Google Chrome
2. Make sure you have python3 and pip installed.
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/azh412/Pathfinder.git`
4. Install all needed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the bot: `python3 main.py` (See Usage)

# Usage

Follow along with the prompts shown when you run the program. It's recommended to store your results in the `out` directory to keep your output files organized.

To terminate the program, press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the process, and the shutdown procedure will occur.
